## 🛑 Problem Statement

Customer churn is a major concern for telecom providers due to its impact on revenue and brand reputation. The company faced several challenges:

- Lack of visibility into service usage patterns 📊
- Unclear impact of contracts and payment methods on churn 💳
- Insufficient insights into demographic behavior 👥

The business needed a **data-driven dashboard** to visualize churn data and uncover patterns that could guide retention strategies.
